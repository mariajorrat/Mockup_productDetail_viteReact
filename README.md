# React + Vite
# MyApp - Product Detail Page

## Introduction
This project is a simple e-commerce product detail page created using React CLI. The application is named "MyApp" and it displays detailed information about a product.

## Features
The product detail page includes the following information:
- **Product Name**: The name of the product.
- **Description**: A brief description of the product.
- **Price**: The price of the product.
- **SKU**: The Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) which is a unique identifier for each distinct product and service that can be purchased.
- **Quantity Available**: The number of units of the product available in stock.

All these details are displayed using individual React components to ensure modularity and reusability of code.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Before you start, make sure Node.js and npm are installed on your system. If not, download and install the latest stable version from the official Node.js website.

2. **Create a new React application**: Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new application named "myapp":
    ```
    npx create-react-app myapp
    ```
3. **Navigate to your application folder**: Use the following command to go to the "myapp" directory:
    ```
    cd myapp
    ```
4. **Start the development server**: Run the following command to start your React development server:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
   A new browser window should now open up with the default React application page. Now you're ready to start developing your product detail page!

## Development

To develop the product detail page, you will need to create a new React component for each piece of product information (name, description, price, SKU, and quantity available). Each component will maintain its own state and props as necessary.

Remember to import React in every component file and export each component so it can be imported and used in other parts of your application.

## Conclusion

This is a basic setup for your application. As you continue to develop, you may want to add more advanced features like user authentication, a shopping cart, product search and filter capabilities, and more. Happy coding!
